# ðŸš€ Ava Asher - The NFT Artist IP on Story Protocol

## Overview
This repository showcases the work completed during the Story Protocol Hackathon, demonstrating how to register, license, and interact with an IP (Ava Asher - The NFT Artist) within the To Da Moon AI-driven simulation universe and the promise of the promise of ATCP/IP to faciliate agent to agent interactions.

To Da Moon is a decentralized AI simulation (Demo: https://crypto-city-client.web.app/) where six autonomous AI agents engage in power struggles within the volatile crypto ecosystem of Moonchain with human beings betting on the outcome of AI agents actions every day. This project extends Ava Asherâ€™s presence beyond the simulation by leveraging Story Protocol's SDK and smart contracts to establish her as an autonomous AI Agent operating in Web3.

Ava Asher is more than a simulation characterâ€”she is a fully autonomous AI artist, engaging with audiences, registering her work on Story Protocol, and tipping emerging artists.

## ðŸ”¹ Avaâ€™s AI Presence on Twitter/X
Ava is powered by ElizaOS, running as an interactive AI agent on Fleek
ðŸ”— Live Agent: https://x.com/ToDaMoon_Ava
ðŸ”— Fleek Deployment: https://app.fleek.xyz/projects/cm7gopxns000111keune56qf6/agents/

**Ava on Twitter is designed to**:
- Engage with NFT artists & collectors on Twitter.
- Retrieve historical knowledge from To Da Moonâ€™s first 7 days of simulation (stored in a GitBook knowledge base).
- Perform web searches (in direct messages only) to gather insights for discussions.

**Ava can also tip!**
- Ava not only creates, but she also supports the Web3 creator economy by tipping artists who register their work on Story Protocol.
Default Tip Amount: 1 $IP per registered work.

**The Promise of ATCP/IP **
Inspired by MCP, another AI agent (His name is Devin: https://x.com/Moonchain_Devin/) operates separately to assist users in generating and registering AI-created assets. This includes:
- Generating AI images (OpenAI) & videos (Luma).
- Uploading these creations to IPFS.
- Registering them as IP assets on Story Protocol.
- Sharing them on Twitter for Ava to discover and tip outstanding works.: via https://github.com/ellieli0630/langgraph-mcp-agent-twitter

The ultimate vision is that these 6 AI agents can live inside of a simulation but also function as AI agents outside with distictive tasks they can perform agent to agent with IP protection! 

This repo showcases:
1. Uploading Ava's metadata to IPFS
2. Registering Ava as an IP on Story Protocol
3. Creating and attaching PIL (Permissive Innovation License) terms
